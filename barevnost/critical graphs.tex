\chapter{Critical graphs}

\begin{exerc}
	If $G$ is $k$-critical, then it is $2$-connected.
\end{exerc}

\begin{proof}[Solution]
	Lets take a graph $G$ which has $\chi(G) = k$ but for all $H \subsetneq G$ $\chi(H) = k-1$. If $G$ is not connected then one component must have the largest $\chi(G)$, but if we remove vertex or edge from other component we don't achieve $\chi(H)$. That is contradiction.
	
	Now assume it is 1-conencted. Therefore we have a vertex cut $M = \{v\}$ which splits the graph to two components $G_1$ and $G_2$. Lets fix graphs $G_1 \cup \{v\}$ and $G_2 \cup \{v\}$ where both of them have chromatic number $k - 1$ since they are subgraphs. Lets fix those colorings. Now for one coloring switch the colors so that $v$ has the same color for both colorings. Therefore we have $G$ colored by $k-1$ colors which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
	If $G$ is $(c+1)$-critical for $c \geq 3$ and $G \neq K_{c+1}$ then the average degree is
	
	$$
	\bar{d} \geq c + \frac{c-2}{c^2 - 2c -2} \approx c + \frac{1}{c} \quad (\text{for large } c)
	$$
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
	If $G$ is $(c+1)$-critical, then
	
	$$
	\bar{d} \geq c+1 - \frac{2}{c} - O\left( \frac{1}{|V(G)|}\right)
	$$
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
	If $G$ is 4-critical, then
	
	$$
	|E(G)| \geq \frac{5 \cdot |V(G)| - 2}{3} \Rightarrow \bar{d} \geq \frac{10}{3} - \frac{4}{3 \cdot |V(G)|}
	$$
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
	Suppose $H$ is 4-critical plane graph. Let $f_i$ be the number of faces of length $i$ in a drawing of $H$. Therefore by Euler's formula we get the following.
	
	$$
	\begin{aligned}
		|V(G)| + |F(G)| &= |E(G)| + 2 \\
		|V(G)| + \sum_{i \geq 3} f_i &= |E(G)| + 2 \\
		\frac{5}{3}|V(G)| + \frac{5}{3}\sum_{i \geq 3} f_i &= \frac{5}{3}|E(G)| + \frac{10}{3} \\
	\end{aligned}
	$$
