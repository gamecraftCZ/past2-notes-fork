\chapter{Introduction}

Firstly we remind some basics from flows and cuts. 

\section{Network flow}

\textbf{Flow} is defined on a \textbf{network}. Network is on a oriented graph $G = (V,E)$ and it has two special vertices $s,t \in V$ called source and target. Also we have a capacity, which is a mapping $c : E \to \R_{0}^{+}$. Flow then is a mapping $f : E \to \R_{0}^{+}$ which has two properties.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\forall e \in E: f(e) \leq c(e)$
	\item Kirchoff's law: $\forall v \neq s, t \in V: \sum_{uv \in E} f(uv) - \sum_{vu \in E} f(vu) = 0$
\end{enumerate}

\section{Min $s,t$-cut}

Now we also remind ourselves another term which is an $s,t$-cut. Which is a $M \subseteq E$ such that no $s,t$-path exists in $G' = (V, E \setminus M)$.

These basic terms can be generalized to a \textbf{multi-commodity flow} problem and \textbf{multi-cut} problem.
